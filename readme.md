Start scrapping entire vehicles, tired of hunting warehouse to warehouse, construction complex to complex? Fear no more, you can salvage tires and windows but not fuel tank parts or engine parts? This changes that!

THIS IS A WIP! I have brought it a long way, but Ive got a lot more I want to do with this. As of right now, you can walk up to a vehicle that is unlocked, unoccupied(i hope) and not already blown dafuq up and reduce it into parts. This will allow you to salvage scrap, tank parts and engine parts (eventually rotors with aircraft when I get there). Its instantaneous (for now) and drops all loot into a box. All loot has a chance to generate, with failures actually damaging the parts you were working on, too much bad luck and vehicle WILL BLOW UP! Once you hit success, the amount of loot in the box is not locked, it will spawn a configured random amount each time. (there is a very rare chance you can succeed and get an empty box, laughed my batoutie off when it happend, on the toDO list). If you are interested, the install is below.

Install
This basically assumes you have installed one of the other, various, better, more important, better written mods already and therefore already have a custom compiles/variables/fn_selfActions. So we are going to skip that part and move onto the other stuff.

Pretty straightforward. Drag and drop the scrapper folder into your scripts folder (or change the filepaths if you migrate it elsewhere) apply the additional snippets in variables and selfActions to your files.

Variables are configurable and this is easily expandable to cover so many more vehicles. My plan is to eventually cover all the vehicles in Epoch and Overwatch.
